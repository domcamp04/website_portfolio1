      <h4>Annual Buddies Golf Trip</h4>
      <p>Every year, three of my best friends and I go on a golf trip. Our goal is to play all of the best courses throught the midwest and our only rule when planning is that it has to be drivable. This year we went to French Lick, Indiana which is home to two world class courses. Last year we went to Whistling Straits in Wisconsin which is the home of the 2021 Ryder Cup!</p>

      <h4>Peter Francis Boland</h4>
      <p>This is Peter Francis Boland and as I said earlier, he's one of the coolest kids in town. Not only is he my nephew but also my godson which I do not take lightly. This picture shown above is us at dinner just a few days after his first birthday! His hobbies include putting things in his mouth, throwing things off his high-chair, and being really really handsome.</p>
      
     <p>What do we think of Peter?:</p>

      <h3>Why I chose to pursue this...</h3>
      <p>All my life I listened to what other people told me to do. I majored in business communications and took account manager and sales positions all because others told me it's what I was born to do. Turns out I hated it and working on commission is not very fun. My brother in law has been a back end developer for about 6 years now which is what inspired me to do some freecodecamp.org classes. I was instantly hooked, put my two weeks notice in, and found a boot camp that will provide me with the resources to succeed in this industry. I couldn't be more excited to start my journey at Coding Temple!</p>
